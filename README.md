This is my packagedistribution with my customized flavours of vim for windows and unix. The unix-style does also work on macintosh (at least on Max OS X 10.3).

I am a lot working on different operating system. Thanks to Bram Moolenar, I have at least my favourite editor on every system. Because I am also sometimes working on the terminal, I customized the vimrc, that it is working on Mac, Linux and Windows XP, at least on the most common versions of it. Thus I am always stumbled arround, getting my vim personalized, I decided to have at least the plugins and all the configuration files packaged.

First I wanted also to have the installation files packaged with them, but because this had meant to get at least 10 or more packages to be held always up to date, I decided to keep just the plugins and the configuration files around on my ftp, thus I get faster on every system my personalized vim.

My first customized vimrc is from a version something below 6.2. Since then it is evolving permanently and I am collecting some usefull scripts and plugins. Some are using external programs, maybe not available on all systems, but at least working on windows and debian, e.g. xmllint to format XML. I try to keep the plugins up to date, but because I just started this kind of organization of my vim configuration, it is maybe not always the latest version and some are surely damn old.

Following I am using:
pdftk.vim

Following external programs:
xmllint
