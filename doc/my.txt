ABOUT                                             *my-about* *personal-about*

This is my vim configuration of vim for windows, unix and mac. The unix-style does also work on macintosh (at least on Max OS X 10.3).

I am a lot working on different operating system. Thanks to Bram Moolenar, I have at least my favourite editor on every system. Because I am also sometimes working on the terminal, I customized the vimrc, that it is working on Mac, Linux and Windows, at least on the most common versions of it. I try to support Cygwin as well. Because I always stumbled arround, getting my vim personalized, I decided to have at least the plugins and all the configuration files packaged.

My first customized vimrc is from a version something below 6.2. Since then it is evolving permanently and I am collecting some usefull scripts and plugins. Some are using external programs, maybe not available on all systems, but at least working on windows and debian, e.g. xmllint to format XML. I try to keep the plugins up to date, but because I just started this kind of organization of my vim configuration, it is maybe not always the latest version and some are surely damn old.

===============================================================================
STRUCTURE AND INSTALLATION											*my-structure* *personal-structure*

The structure of this project is very simple. On Windows just copy the files to your home directory in the directory named vimfiles . On all other systems this directory is called .vim . Then copy the files gvimrc_base and vimrc_base to your home directory.

>
    On Windows:

    > copy gvimrc_base ..\_gvimrc
    > copy vimrc_base ..\_vimrc

>
		On Mac and Unix:

    $ cp gvimrc_base ../.gvimrc
    $ cp vimrc_base ../.vimrc

Depending on which system you are, the files and plugins are sourced.

If you are using the vim version with gui *gvim* the file *gvimrc_base* is loaded. The file *vimrc_base* will alway be loaded.

Compiles scss to css in the same folder. This function depends on the ruby gem [sass](http://sass-lang.com/).
- *CompileLESS()* or *:LESS*
Compiles less to css in the same folder. This function depends on  [lessc](https://github.com/duncansmart/less.js-windows).

Formats XML and sets the encoding to UTF-8. This function depends on [xmllint](http://xmlsoft.org/xmllint.html).
- *SetJavaClasspath()*
To get better code completion you have to set your java classpath. If you got an maven project, this script searches upwards for your pom.xml.
If you want to reset the java classpath call it with the argument 1 *:call SetJavaClasspath(1)*. This function sets your classpath
depending on your pom.xml. It creates a classpath file .occp (OmniCompletionClassPath) for faster running the next time next to your pom.xml.
To rerun this function on next start of vim, just hit <F8>. Alternatively you can create your own .occp-File manually.
